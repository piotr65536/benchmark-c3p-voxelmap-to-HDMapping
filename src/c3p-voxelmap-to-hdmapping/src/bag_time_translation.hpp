// Translate an algorithm's output timestamps into bag time.
//
// The benchmark never changes an algorithm's own clock: C3P-VoxelMap, for
// example, stamps its outputs with ros::Time::now(), which is wall-clock time
// at processing, and its internal logic depends on that. The HDMapping result,
// however, must be in bag time so that it can be aligned with the ground truth.
//
// The run script therefore records /clock next to the algorithm's outputs.
// "rosbag play --clock" publishes bag time on /clock, and rosbag record stores
// every message at its wall-clock receive time, so for each /clock message
//     receive time - payload = wall-clock minus bag time
// which is constant while the bag plays at normal rate. Subtracting that one
// constant from every pose and point stamp moves the result into bag time and
// keeps all relative timing, and the point-to-pose association, intact.
